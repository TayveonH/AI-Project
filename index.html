			<h2>About the website</h2>
			<p>The project is focused on developing a learning tool for an AI course based on the book "The Quest for
				Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements" by Nils J. Nilsson, a renowned researcher
				at Stanford University. The primary objective of the project is to create a website/webapp that
				showcases essential algorithms in AI, along with their relevant information.
				The learning tool will be designed for students and researchers in the field of AI, with the primary aim
				of providing a comprehensive overview of the different algorithms used in AI. The tool will cover a
				range of topics, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics,
				among others.
				The website/webapp will be designed to be user-friendly, intuitive, and interactive. Users will be able
				to browse through different algorithms, view relevant information, and even try out the algorithms
				themselves. The tool will provide users with the ability to learn about the history and evolution of AI,
				including key breakthroughs and innovations.
				One of the key features of the learning tool will be the use of visual aids, such as diagrams,
				animations, and interactive simulations. These features will help users to understand complex algorithms
				and their working principles more easily. Additionally, the tool will also provide users with links to
				relevant research papers, books, and other resources, allowing them to deepen their understanding of the
				different topics.
				The website/webapp will be developed using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
				ReactJS. The tool will also be designed to be responsive, allowing users to access it from different
				devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones.
				Overall, the project aims to provide an accessible and engaging learning tool for AI students and
				researchers. By providing a comprehensive overview of the different algorithms used in AI, the tool will
				help users to deepen their understanding of the subject and stay up to date with the latest developments
				in the field
