                <h3>Chapter 8 - 1960s' Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>
                    The 1960s saw significant technical developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), aided by a number of systems support and societal factors. The emergence of new computer languages made it easier to build AI systems, and researchers from various fields including mathematics, cognitive science, linguistics, and computer science came together to work on the problem of mechanizing intelligent behavior. Government agencies and companies also provided research support, recognizing the importance of AI as a new enterprise. These factors contributed to the growth and advancement of AI during this time period.
                    <br><br>
                    The development of a specialized computer language for manipulating symbolic expressions was essential for the mechanization of intelligence. Newell, Shaw, and Simon developed the IPL language series, which was used to program early AI systems such as LT, GPS, and NSS. John McCarthy, after the Dartmouth summer project, created LISP (list processing), which had simpler elementary operations for manipulating lists and allowed programs for manipulating lists to be represented as lists themselves. LISP replaced IPL as the primary language of AI research and applications. McCarthy also proposed a method called "time-sharing" for making a single computer serve several users simultaneously, which he developed at MIT using a DEC PDP-1 computer.
                    <br><br>
                    The most elementary kind of symbolic expression is a list of symbols, such as (7, B, 5). More complex structures can be composed by creating lists of lists of symbols and lists of lists of lists, and so on.
                    <br><br>
                    In the description of symbol structures for the eight-puzzle, it mentions the kinds of manipulations that are needed. Recall that the starting position of the eight-puzzle was represented by the expression: 
                    <br><br>
                    ((2, 8, 3), (1, 6, 4), (7, B, 5)).
                    <br><br>
                    What was needed was a language for writing programs that could produce expressions representing the positions corresponding to moves of the puzzle. For example, one of the moves that can be made from the starting position is represented by the expression: 
                    <br><br>
                    ((2, 8, 3), (1, 6, 4), (B, 7, 5)).
                    <br><br>
                    To produce this expression, the program must copy the starting position expression and then interchange the first and second elements of the third list in that expression. Newell, Shaw, and Simon set about to develop a language in which these kinds of manipulations could be programmed.

                    <br><br>
                    The development of artificial intelligence (AI) began in the mid-1950s with the work of John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky at MIT, Allen Newell and Herbert Simon at Carnegie Mellon University, and Donald Michie at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Newell and Simon used the phrase "complex information processing" to describe their work and avoided the term AI for several years. In 1956, Herb Simon obtained an IBM 650, which was the first computer used for CIP work. In 1958, McCarthy moved to MIT, and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Project was formed. The group used a DEC PDP-1, and with funding from another project at MIT, it bought its own PDP-1. Several of the group's Ph.D. students did their work at BBN and at the nearby Lincoln Laboratory. In 1962, McCarthy moved to Stanford where he began an AI project. Seymour Papert joined Minsky as co-director of the AI Lab in 1963. By 1965, McCarthy and colleagues had created a time-sharing system, called Thor, on a PDP-1 computer. SAIL was established in 1965 with the help of Lester Earnest, who had moved to Stanford from Lincoln Laboratory. Around 1965, the University of Edinburgh's Donald Michie founded another world-class AI center. Michie's group was to become the Department of Machine Intelligence and Perception in October 1966. Michie recruited some top-flight computer talent, including Rod Burstall, Robin Popplestone, and John Collins. IBM in Poughkeepsie, Nathan Rochester and Herb Gelernter continued AI research for a short time after the Dartmouth workshop. This research resulted in the geometry-theorem-proving machine.

                    <br><br>
                    As the field of artificial intelligence (AI) began to grow and the computing systems necessary for research became more expensive, securing financial support became increasingly necessary. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, two major sources of funding for AI research were the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), both part of the U.S. defense establishment.
                    <br><br>
                    The ONR's Information Systems Branch was established in the mid-1950s to support AI work at several institutions and sponsored conferences and workshops on self-organizing systems, cybernetics, optical character recognition, and AI. The branch's mission was to foster scientific research that would be useful to the U.S. Navy. ARPA was created in response to the successful launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik in 1957 and aimed to provide significant research funds to address problems important to U.S. defense.
                    <br><br>
                    ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) was established in 1962 under the direction of J.C.R. "Lick" Licklider, who believed that computers would play an important role in defense, especially in applications where people and computers worked together. ARPA provided funds to MIT for the formation of Project MAC, which took Minsky and McCarthy's Artificial Intelligence Project under its wing and supported the development of MIT's Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). ARPA's funds helped establish "centers of excellence" in computer science, including MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and SRI.
                    <br><br>
                    Although AI was just one of ARPA's interests, Lick believed that Newell and Simon, Minsky, and McCarthy ought to be provided with research funds adequate to support big AI projects. ARPA's support for AI research was largely responsible for the development of today's computer-based infrastructure.

                    <br><br>
                    In the mid-1960s, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was well poised for further advances and was expected to make rapid progress during the rest of the 1960s and 1970s. Enthusiastic predictions were made about the future of AI, with Herb Simon predicting in 1957 that within ten years, computers would be able to compose music, prove a mathematical theorem, and even become the world's chess champion. Simon believed that machines could think, learn, and create, and that their abilities would increase rapidly until they could handle problems coextensive with the range of human minds.
                    <br><br>
                    Although some of Simon's predictions were realized soon after he made them, such as computers composing music and proving a mathematical theorem, it took forty years before a computer became a chess champion. Moreover, achieving things coextensive with what the human mind can achieve still seems far off. Other AI experts, such as Marvin Minsky, were also optimistic, predicting that machines with intelligence comparable to humans could be developed within 30 years.
                    <br><br>
                    By the year 2000, AI programs had outperformed humans in many intellectual feats, although they still had a long way to go in most others. Despite this, what had already been accomplished in AI was impressive, and the technical base developed during the 1950s and early 1960s provided a solid foundation for the next stage of AI's development. AI researchers had developed ways to represent knowledge, such as encoding it in networks, logical formulas, or other symbol structures, and had accumulated experience with heuristic search and other techniques for manipulating and using that knowledge. They also had access to new programming languages, such as IPL, LISP, and POP-2, which made it easier to write symbol-processing programs. In addition, there were neural networks and statistical approaches to pattern recognition that complemented the symbol-processing technology. All of these technical assets, along with organizational and financial resources, provided a strong foundation for the future of AI.
